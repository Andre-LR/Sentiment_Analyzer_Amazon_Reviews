# About the project
The main goal of this project is to implements classifiers machine learning algorithms to label differents reviews given to amazon products (positive, negative and neutral). The chosen ML algorithms were K-nn, Vader and Logistic Regression.

The project was developed in 5 stages:
  - Dataset reading and analysis
  - Pre-processing with data cleaning
  - Creating training, validation and testing datasets
  - Model classification
  - Results
 
 In order to verify the accuracy of the results obtained, the following evaluation metrics were used:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F-measure
  
 # Technologies and libraries 
  - Python
  - Jupyter
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Scikit-learn (sklearn)
  - Natural Language Toolkit (nltk)
